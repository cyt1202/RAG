内容:                           Figure 3.

To address the gap in hair color prediction and design, an AI-based mirror called ChronoMirror 
is introduced. ChronoMirror can take you on a time tour. Your past and future versions can be obtained 
by sliding the time slot. As shown in Figure 1, past hair version and condition, current recommended hair
care plan, and future hair color prediction will be shown on the screen, determined by the position of the 
time slot.

Benefits:

ChronoMirror is a technology-based, user-friendly product that provides personalized predictions
 and recommendations in hair care. It is data-driven, giving more scientific results than experienced-driven 
 solutions. It focuses on personalized analysis, which is more precise than conventional solutions. 
 By continuously collecting multi-temporal hair data, it quantifies hair health metrics and stores hair images. 
 Thanks to ChronoMirror, users can easily track the difference in hair color and quality.

scanning data and the user’s ideal hair color as data inputs. User can use the handle to scan their hair. 
The handle is integrated with K-Scan, a smart camera that uses UV, Cross-polarized, and White LED light to
reveal the microscopic features, subsurface redness and irritation, etc. (L’Oréal, 2022). 
The input data are then uploaded to our server by Wi-Fi 6.'

Conclusion:

In conclusion, given the sizeable hair-dying population and the 
currently unprecise prediction and recommendation issues, ChronoMirror is introduced. 
It uses advanced algorithms and AI tools to predict hair color fading trends and recommend 
suitable hair care products according to personal data. The result of ChronoMirror is more scientific
and precise, and the design philosophy gives users more sustainable hair beauty solutions. By using
ChronoMirror, you can traverse time and unlock your hair beauty.'

Limitations of related work
While numerous educational websites and applications are available, most focus on distinct features. What's more, few all-
in-on applications cater to the diverse needs of students. Although the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, has
proposed "Fries Artificial Intelligence" with similar goals to ours, it is unstable and may encounter issues such as failing to
load files or the AI being unable to function properly. What's more, "Fries Artificial Intelligence"'s ai, chatgpt 4o, can only

for the hole course with mutil-files. Our application ICE, developed in C++, is faster in performance speed. It also supports

Fries Artificial Intelligence is a website that focuses on helping students at the Chinese University of Hong Kong,
Shenzhen, to read PPT. It uses AI to translate every PPT to help the students to understand it. However, it does not
support creating your workspace and managing related files. It can only search on a course basis, while our
project supports searching for file names and adding those files into the users' workspace for a specific subject.
Our project and Fries Artificial Intelligence are both all-in-one study platforms. Fries Artificial Intelligence'
